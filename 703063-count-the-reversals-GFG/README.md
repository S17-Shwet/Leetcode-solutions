# [Count the Reversals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-the-reversals0401/1)
## Medium
Given a string s consisting of only opening and closing curly brackets '{' and '}',&nbsp;find out the minimum&nbsp;number of reversals required to convert the string into a balanced expression. A reversal means changing&nbsp;'{'&nbsp;to&nbsp;'}'&nbsp;or vice-versa.Examples:
Input: s = "}{{}}{{{"
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to balance is:
"{{{}}{}}". There is no balanced sequence
that can be formed in lesser reversals.

Input: s = "{{}{{{}{{}}{{"
Output: -1
Explanation: There's no way we can balance
this sequence of braces.

Constraints:1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105
